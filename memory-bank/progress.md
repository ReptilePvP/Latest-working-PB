# Progress: Loss Prevention Log System

## Current Status
- Memory bank initialization in progress
- Core functionality implemented
- UI design and implementation complete
- Basic logging and WiFi features operational

## What Works
1. User Interface
   - Main menu with card-style design
   - Gender, color, and item selection screens
   - Settings menu (WiFi, Sound, Display, Date & Time, Power Management)
   - Log viewing screen with pagination
   - WiFi management screen

2. Core Functionality
   - Loss prevention entry logging
   - SD card storage for log entries
   - Real-time clock synchronization (NTP when online, RTC as fallback)
   - WiFi connection management
   - Power management (power off, restart, sleep mode)

3. Data Management
   - Log entry creation and storage
   - Log retrieval and display
   - Date and time management

4. Hardware Integration
   - Touch screen input handling
   - Button input from M5Stack Dual Button & Key unit
   - SD card read/write operations
   - Display output via LVGL

## What's Left to Build
1. Cloud Integration
   - Implement full cloud synchronization for remote access to logs
   - Develop user authentication for secure cloud access

2. Advanced Features
   - Search functionality for log entries
   - Filtering options for log viewing (by date, gender, item)
   - Photo capture capability (requires additional hardware)

3. Reporting and Analytics
   - Implement basic data analysis features
   - Generate reports based on collected data

4. Security Enhancements
   - Encrypted log storage
   - User authentication for local access

5. Performance Optimizations
   - Further battery life improvements
   - Memory usage optimizations
   - UI rendering speed enhancements

## Known Issues
1. WiFi connection stability in certain environments
2. Occasional slow SD card read/write operations for large log files
3. Potential for screen burn-in with static UI elements
4. Limited support for non-English languages and special characters

## Next Steps
1. Conduct thorough testing of existing features
2. Begin implementation of cloud integration
3. Develop and integrate search functionality for logs
4. Investigate and implement log encryption
5. Optimize battery usage and overall performance
6. Expand error handling and system robustness

## Recent Changes
- Initialized memory bank with core documentation files
- Implemented power management features (power off, restart, sleep mode)
- Enhanced WiFi management with visual feedback and improved connection handling
- Added date and time configuration screens

This progress report reflects the current state of the Loss Prevention Log System project. It will be updated regularly as development continues and new features are implemented or issues are resolved.
