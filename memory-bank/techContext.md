# Technical Context: Loss Prevention Log System

## Platform
- **Hardware**: M5Stack CoreS3
- **Microcontroller**: ESP32-S3

## Development Environment
- **Framework**: Arduino framework for ESP32
- **Build System**: PlatformIO

## Primary Technologies

### 1. M5Stack CoreS3
- 2" IPS LCD touchscreen (320x240 resolution)
- Built-in battery management
- RTC (Real-Time Clock)
- SD card slot
- Wi-Fi connectivity
- Power management via AXP2101 and AW9523 chips

### 2. ESP32-S3 Microcontroller
- Dual-core processor
- Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities
- Low power consumption

### 3. LVGL (Light and Versatile Graphics Library)
- Version: 9.2.2
- Used for creating the graphical user interface
- Provides efficient rendering and memory management

## Libraries and Dependencies

1. **M5Unified** (0.2.4+)
   - Unified library for M5Stack devices
   - Provides hardware abstraction and simplified API

2. **M5GFX** (0.2.6+)
   - Graphics library for M5Stack
   - Optimized for M5Stack displays

3. **LVGL** (8.4.0)
   - Main UI framework

4. **ESP32Time** (2.0.6+)
   - Time management library for ESP32

5. Other standard ESP32 Arduino libraries

## Hardware Interfaces

1. **Display**
   - 320x240 pixel IPS LCD touchscreen
   - Managed through LVGL library
   - Touch input handled by `my_touchpad_read()` function
   - Display driver flush callback: `my_disp_flush()`

2. **SD Card**
   - Connected via SPI interface
   - Pins:
     - SCK: 36
     - MISO: 35
     - MOSI: 37
     - CS: 4
   - Initialized using `initFileSystem()`

3. **Button Interface**
   - M5Stack Dual Button & Key unit
   - Connected via I2C (address: 0x58, AW9523 chip)
   - Used for navigation and selection

## Technical Constraints

1. **Memory Limitations**
   - ESP32-S3 has limited RAM
   - Requires efficient memory management and UI optimization

2. **Power Management**
   - Battery-powered device
   - Requires efficient power usage strategies

3. **Wi-Fi Connectivity**
   - Dependent on available networks
   - Needs robust connection management and fallback mechanisms

4. **Storage Limitations**
   - SD card storage capacity
   - Efficient log storage and retrieval mechanisms needed

5. **Real-time Operations**
   - Time-sensitive logging requires accurate timekeeping
   - Synchronization between RTC and NTP when available

## Development Workflow

1. Code development in PlatformIO environment
2. Version control (assumed to be Git)
3. Compilation and flashing to M5Stack CoreS3 hardware
4. Testing on physical device
5. Debugging using Serial monitor and on-screen feedback

## Future Considerations

1. **Cloud Integration**: Potential for full cloud synchronization of logs
2. **Advanced UI Features**: Possible addition of photo capture, search functionality
3. **Hardware Expansion**: Support for additional M5Stack modules (e.g., RFID reader, barcode scanner)
4. **Security Enhancements**: Potential for encrypted log storage and user authentication
5. **Performance Optimizations**: Ongoing improvements for battery life, memory usage, and UI rendering

This technical context provides a comprehensive overview of the technologies, constraints, and considerations involved in the development and maintenance of the Loss Prevention Log System.
