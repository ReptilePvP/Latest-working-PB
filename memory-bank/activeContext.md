# Active Context: Loss Prevention Log System

## Current Focus
- Initializing the memory bank for the Loss Prevention Log System project

## Recent Changes
- Created projectbrief.md file
- Created productContext.md file

## Next Steps
1. Create remaining core memory bank files:
   - systemPatterns.md
   - techContext.md
   - progress.md
2. Review all created files for completeness and accuracy
3. Determine the next phase of development or implementation

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Ensuring all core aspects of the project are properly documented in the memory bank
- Maintaining consistency across all memory bank files
- Preparing for potential future enhancements or modifications to the system

## Open Questions
- Are there any immediate tasks or features that need to be prioritized after memory bank initialization?
- Are there any specific coding standards or practices that should be documented for future development?

## Notes
- The memory bank initialization marks the beginning of a more structured approach to project documentation and development
- Regular updates to these files will be crucial for maintaining an accurate project overview
